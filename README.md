# In case of emergency frontend

## What is this?

This is a simple solidJS app I built to teach myself some of the basics of the framework and prove out that I could host static experiments well on my personal site. It integrates with a Go backend to allow me to send emergency plans for outdoor adventures to my family.

## Why did I build it?

It's important to always leave plans of where you're going and when people should expect to hear back from you when exploring backcountry areas, particularly without cell reception.

## Where can I learn more?

I'll publish a blog post about the project soon! It's pretty simple.
